# However, you may need to add this host to docker-compose.yml. If that does not work, you can try the private local ip address (e.g. http://192.168.1.15:8545). You can find that with `ip addr show` or a similar command.
# In addition, you can use your public ip address followed by the specific ports for http and ws (e.g. http://82.168.1.15:8545). You can find that with `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`.
